Yes I know the UI looks quite terrible, sorry it was my first time ever working with a UI and I didn't have much time before the deadline
this is also my first time ever doing any webscraping or having code from two different languages work together (java and python)
To run this program you will need to assure that you have a Java JDK installed (recommended version: java 10.0.2)
You will also need to be sure that you have python3 installed (recommended version: 3.8.2) 
NOTE: it must be python3 not python
Within python you need to have the selenium library installed 
to install go to command line and type "pip3 install selenium"
should pip not be installed then type "curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py"
then "python3 get-pip.py"
to run the actual program cd (change directory) to the folder in which you downloaded the code (should be *./FBLA)
then type "javac RunMe.java && java RunMe"
